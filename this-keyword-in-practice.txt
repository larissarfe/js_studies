=========== > THIS KEYWORD IN PRACTICE 

THE THIS KEYWORD OUTSIDE ANY FUNCTION WHATSOEVER

with a regular function call the this keyword will simply point to undefined and with a regular function call 

A REGULAR FUNCTION MEANS A FUNCTION BEING CALLED WITHOU THE FUNCTION BEING ATTACHED TO ANY OBJECT 

THE THIS KEYWORD INSIDE AN ARROW FUNCTION USES THE DISC KEYWORD OF IT'S PARENTS FUNCTION OR IT'S PARENTS SCOPE - SO IT USES THE LEXICAL THIS KEYWORD


THE THIS KEY WORD INSIDE OF A METHOD WILL BE THE OBJECT THAT IS CALLING THE METHOD: 

const jonas{
    year: 1991,
    calcAge = function () { 
        console.log(this); this = JONAS 
    },
};


jonas.calcAge(1991);-=---- instead of doing this:



const jonas{
    year: 1989,
    calcAge = function () { 
        console.log(this); this = JONAS 
        console.log(2037 - this.year); -> DO THIS USE THE YEAR INDISE THE OBJECT ITSELF -- USE THE THIS KEYWORD TO REFERRENCE THAT

    },
};


--> THE THIS KEYWORD WILL POINT TO THE OBJECT THAT IS CALLING THE METHOD

    -- AND THAT MEANS THAT THE THIS KEYWORD WILL NOT SIMPLY POINT AT THE OBJECT IN WHICH WE WROTE THE METHOD 


    ------======---======> IN THIS EXAMPLE WE WROTE THE calcAge METHOD INSIDE OF THE JONAS OBJECT. 
                AND SO WE MIGHT THINK THAT THAT'S THE REASON WHY THE THIS KEYWORD POINT TO JONAS BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE!!!!!!!!


                ====> THE REASON THAT THE THIS KEYWORD WILL POINT TO THE OBJECT JONAS IN THIS CASE WAS BECAUSE JONAS WAS THE 
                OBJECT CALLING THAT METHOD 

                THAT'S A SUBTLE BUT VERY IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE 


*** A FUNCTION IS JUST A VALUE!!!!! - SO WE CAN DO THIS: 

    const matilda = {
        year = 2017
    }

    matilda.calcAge = jonas.calcAge -> WITHOUT CALLING IT WITH ()

    AND JUST LIKE THAT MATILDA WILL HAVE THE METHOD calcAge

    DOING THIS WE COPIED THE METHOD FROM ONE OBJECT TO THE OTHER -> THIS IS CALLED METHOD BORROWING, SO WE DON'T HAVE TO WRITE IT IN A DUPLICATE WAY 

    SO THE THIS KEYWORD ALWAYS POINTS TO THE OBJECT WHO IS CALLING THE METHOD 
    SO EVEN THOUGH THE METHOD IS WRITTEN INSIDE ANOTHER OBJECT (JONAS) 
    THE THIS KEYWORD WILL NOW POINT TO MATILDA, WHO CALLS THE METHOD


THE THIS KEYWORD IS REALLY DYNAMIC!!! AND IT DEPENDS ON HOW THE FUNCTION IS CALLED 

AND WE CAN TAKE THIS EVEN FURTHER BY BASICALLY TAKING THE FUNCTION OUT OF THE JONAS OBJECT
