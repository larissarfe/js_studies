-----> SCOPÍNG IN PRACTICE 

function calcAge(birthYear) {
  const age = 2037 - birthYear;
  return age;
}

//console.log(calcAge(1991));

// THIS FUNCTION IS GLOBAL SCOPED, TOP LEVEL CODE.
// THIS FUNCTION ALSO CREATES IT'S OWN SCOPE
// AND THAT SCOPE IS GOING TO BE EQUIVALENT TO THE VARIABLE ENVIROMENT OF ITS EXECUTION CONTEXT


// for scoping the parameter of a function works just like a normal variable 
// the scope of a variable is the entire region where this variable is accessible 

// THE SCOPE OF A VARIABLE DECLARED WITH VAR IT'S ALL THE FUNCTION SCOPE NOT THE BLOCK 

//----------- > FUNCTIONS ARE ALSO BLOCK SCOPED 

THE SCOPE OF A FUNCTION IS ONLY THE BLOCK IN WHICH THEY WERE DEFINED 

SO IF A FUNCTION IS CREATED INSIDE OF AN IF STATEMENT BLOCK IT'S SCOPE WILL ONLY BE INSIDE OF THE IF BLOCK 
- THAT IS ONLY TRUE FOR STRICT MODE 

- WE CAN HAVE DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS WITH THE SAME PARAMETERS NAME 
    
    BECAUSE EACH PARAMETER IS ONLY DEFINED IN THAT SCOPE OF THAT FUNCTION
