SCOPE CHAIN VS CALL STACK::: 

CALL STACK,  EXECUTION CONTEXT, VARIABLE ENVIROMENTS AND SCOPE ARE ALL RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER 



----------------------------- SCOPE CHAIN VS. CALL STACK  

VARIABLE ENVIROMENT: IT'S WHERE ALL THE VARIABLES AND FUNCTIONS DECLARATIONS ARE STORED

EACH FUNCTION IN THE VARIABLE ENVIROMENT WILL HAVE IT'S OWN SCOPE - WHICH CONTAINS ALL THE VARIABLES THAT ARE DECLARED INSIDE OF THE FUNCTION 

A FUNCTION SCOPE CONTAINS EXACTLY THE SAME THING AS THE VARIABLE ENVIROMENT OF THE FUNCTION EXECUTION CONTEXT 

EXECUTION CONTEXTS ARE INSIDE THE CALL STACK 

THE SCOPE CHAINS ARE ALL ABOUT THE ORDER IN WHICH THE FUNCTIONS ARE WRITTEN IN THE CODE 

-> THE SCOPE CHAIN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORDER IN WHICH FUNCTIONS WERE CALLED 

-> IN ORDER WORDS, THE SCOPE CHAIN HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORDER OF THE EXECUTION CONTEXT IN THE CALL STACK 

-> THE SCOPE CHAIN DOES GET THE VARIABLE ENVIROMENTS FROM THE EXECUTION CONTEXT 

-> THE ORDER OF FUNCTION CALLS IS NOT RELEVANT TO THE SCOPE CHAIN AT ALL
